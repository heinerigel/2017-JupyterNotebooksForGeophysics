# 2017-JupyterNotebooksForGeophysics
MSc Geophysics Seminar on developing Jupyter Notebooks for Geophysics 


## Scope
This course aims at discussing advanced computational methods in seismology, and other topics with the aim of developing skills to write and maintain Jupyter Notebooks for small projects and teaching. In addition we learn some basic tools for code development (github). 

## Format
Participating students will prepare basic theoretical concepts, simple python-based notebooks, and possibly report on some applications of methodologies in geosciences.

## Potential topics

* FD simulations of seismic noise
* Earthquake location problem using linear algebra
* Earthquake location problem using probabilistic methods
* Simple homogenization examples
* Elastic code in 2D
* Simple rupture problems in 1D or 2D
* Tomographic inversion using linear algebra

## Specific suggestions

* Analysis of the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake
Part 1: Instrument response and spectral analysis (based on C. Tape matlab scripsts), involves conversion to ObsPy
Part 2: Analyzing the effects of rupture complexity and Earth heterogeneity
* Probabilistic earthquake source location inversion based on existing matlab scripts
* Review, update, understanding if existing notebook on homogenization by S. Singh, Y. Capdeville
* A simple 2D staggered grid elastic code based on a Fortran implementation
* Simplest tomographic inversion using linear algebra (Matlab codes exist

## Final Project Allocation
* Dynamic rupture in 2D (Mitch)
* Seismic Tomograpgy (Ashim)
* Earthquake location, probabilistic inversion (Kilian)
* Sumatra earthquake, practicals by C. Tape (Angel, Tomy, Yongki)
* Finite-difference method, summation by parts (Kenneth)
